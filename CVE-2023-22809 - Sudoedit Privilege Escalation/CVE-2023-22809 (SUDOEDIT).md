## [CVE-2023-22809: Sudoedit Privilege Escalation Vulnerability](https://www.synacktiv.com/sites/default/files/2023-01/sudo-CVE-2023-22809.pdf)

**Discovered by:** [Matthieu Barjole](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/matthieu-barjole-bb8790309) and [Victor Cutillas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-c-security/) (from [Synacktiv](https://www.synacktiv.com/en))

**Affected Versions:** Sudo 1.8.0 through 1.9.12p1

**Component:** ```sudoedit``` function in Unix systems

## Vulnerability Overview
* Permits escalation of privileges by overcoming the ```sudoers``` configuration.
* Can be exploited by anyone granted ```sudoedit``` rights.
* Enables modification of files that the policy would otherwise block.

## Exploitation Details
* Triggered when the user-specified editor includes a ```--``` argument.

* The ```--``` causes the sudo front-end to treat all following inputs as file paths.

* This bypasses normal checks and restrictions defined in the sudoers configuration.

## Impact
* Malicious users can gain unauthorized access to sensitive files.
* Potential for root-level privilege escalation.
